# twitch-client

... well, mostly a stripped down chat client for now.

## Why?
There's a few good libraries out there already for this.
Some are functional but not tested.
Some are tested but with bad authentication.
Some just have no types.

This package should solve most of these issues.
Using modern syntax, typescript and cross platform dependencies
paired with vigorous TDD, it should be a safe option for the perfectionists
out there.
